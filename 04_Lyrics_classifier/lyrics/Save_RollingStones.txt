I met a gin-soaked, bar-room queen in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride
She had to heave me right across shoulder
'Cause I just can't seem to drink you off my mind

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

I laid a divorc√©e in New York City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
The lady then she covered me with roses
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues
It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

Smell of you baby, my senses, my senses be praised
Smell of you baby, my senses, my senses be praised

Kissing and running, kissing and running away
Kissing and running, kissing and running away
Senses be praised
Senses be praised

Your my saving grace, saving grace
Nothing will harm you
Nothing will stand in your way
Nothing, nothing
Nothing will stop you
And nothing will stand in your way
No one will harm you
No one will stand in your way
No one will bar you
Nothing will stand in your way
Nothing
There's nothing

I can't feel 
Feel a thing 
I can't shout 
I can't scream 
Breathe it out 
Breathe it in 
All this love 
From within 

I won't cry when you say goodbye 
I'm out of tears 
And I won't die when you wave goodbye 
I'm out of tears 
Out of tears 

I won't drink 
I won't eat 
I can't hear 
I won't speak 
Let it out 
Let it in 
All this pain 
From within 
And I just can't pour my heart out 
To another living thing 
I'm a whisper 
I'm a shadow 
But I'm standing up to sing 

I won't cry when you say goodbye 
I'm out of tears (out of tears)
I won't die when you wave goodbye 
I'm out of tears, yes I am 
I won't cry, I swear my eyes are dry 
I'm out of tears, yeah (out of tears)
I won't cry, I'm going to tell you why 
I'm out of tears 
Out of tears 
Out of tears 

Let it out 
From within 
Some you lose 
Some you win 
I can drift 
I can dream 
'Til I float 
Off your screen 
And I just can't pour my heart out 
To another living thing 
I'm a whisper 
I'm a shadow 
But I'm standing up to sing 

And I won't cry when you say goodbye 
I'm out of tears (out of tears) 
I won't die when you wave goodbye 
I'm out of tears, out of tears
I won't cry, I swear my eyes are dry 
I'm out of tears, out of tears 
I won't cry, I'm going to tell you why 
I'm out of tears 
Out of tears 
Out of tears

Have you seen your mother, baby, standing in the shadow
Have you had another, baby, standing in the shadow?
I'm glad I opened your eyes
The have nots have tried to freeze you in ice

Have you seen your brother, baby, standing in the shadow
Have you had another baby, standing in the shadow
I was just passing the time
I'm all alone, won't you give all your sympathy to mine

Tell me a story about how you adore me
Live in the shadow, see through the shadow,
Live through the shadow, tear at the shadow
Hate in the shadow, and love in your shadowy life

Have you seen your lover, baby, standing in the shadow
Has he had another baby, standing in the shadow
Baby, where have you been all your life
Talking about all the people who should try anything twice

Have you seen your mother, baby, standing in the shadow
Have you had another baby, standing in the shadow
You take your choice at this time
The brave old world or the slide to the depths of decline

Well, you've got your diamonds and you've got your pretty clothes
And the chauffeur drives your car
You let everybody know
But don't play with me, 'cause you're playing with fire

Your mother she's an heiress, owns a block in Saint John's Wood
And your father'd be there with her
If he only could
But don't play with me, 'cause you're playing with fire

Your old man took her diamond's and tiaras by the score
Now she gets her kicks in Stepney
Not in Knightsbridge anymore
So don't play with me, 'cause you're playing with fire

Now you've got some diamonds and you will have some others
But you'd better watch your step, girl
Or start living with your mother
So don't play with me, 'cause you're playing with fire
So don't play with me, 'cause you're playing with fire

Well, baby used to stay out all night long
She made me cry, she done me wrong
She hurt my eyes open, that's no lie
Tables turn and now her turn to cry

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

Well, she used to run around with every man in town
She spent all my money, playing her high class game
She put me out, it was a pity how I cried
Tables turn and now her turn to cry

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

Well, I used to wake in the morning, get my breakfast in bed
When I'd gotten worried she'd ease my aching head
But now she's here and there, with every man in town
Still trying to take me for that same old clown

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

I had a dream last night
That I was piloting a plane
And all the passengers were drunk and insane
I crash landed in a Louisiana swamp
Shot up a horde of zombies
But I come out on top
What's it all about?
Guess it just reflects my mood
Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt

When all I hear is doom and gloom
And all is darkness in my room
Through the light your face I see
Baby take a chance
Baby won't you dance with me

Lost all that treasure in an overseas war
It just goes to show you, don't get what you paid for
Battle to the rich and you worry about the poor
Put my feet up on the couch
And lock all the doors
Hear a funky noise
That's the tightening of the screws
I'm feeling kind of hurt
Sitting in the dirt

All I hear is doom and gloom
But when those drums go boom boom boom
And through the night your face I see
Baby take a chance
Baby won't you dance with me
Yeah
Baby won't you dance with me
Ah yeah

Fracking deep for oil
But there's nothing in the sump
There's kids all picking
Ar the garbage dumb
I'm running out of water
So I better prime the pump
I'm trying to stay sober
But I end up drunk

We'll be eating dirt
Living on the side of the road
There's some food for thought
Kinda makes your head explode
Feeling kind of hurt
Yeah

But all I hear is doom and gloom
And all is darkness in my room
Through the night your face I see
Baby come on
Baby won't you dance with me
Yeah
Yeah
Baby won't you dance with me

I'm feeling kind of hurt
Baby won't you dance with me
Yeah
Come on
Baby won't you dance with me
I'm sitting in the dirt
Baby won't you dance with me!

Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul to waste

And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain

I rode a tank
Held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
Ah, what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah
(Woo woo, woo woo)

I watched with glee
While your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the gods they made
(Woo woo, woo woo)

I shouted out,
Who killed the Kennedys?
When after all
It was you and me
(Who who, who who)

Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reached Bombay
(Woo woo, who who)

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
(Who who)
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby
(Who who, who who)

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's confusing you
Is just the nature of my game
(Woo woo, who who)

Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails
Just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
(Who who, who who)

So if you meet me
Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
(Woo woo)
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, mm yeah
(Woo woo, woo woo)

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, mm yeah
(Who who)
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, mm mean it, get down
(Woo woo, woo woo)

Woo, who
Oh yeah, get on down
Oh yeah
Oh yeah!
(Woo woo)

Tell me baby, what's my name
Tell me honey, can ya guess my name
Tell me baby, what's my name
I tell you one time, you're to blame

Oh, who
Woo, woo
Woo, who
Woo, woo
Woo, who, who
Woo, who, who
Oh, yeah

What's my name
Tell me, baby, what's my name
Tell me, sweetie, what's my name

Woo, who, who
Woo, who, who
Woo, who, who
Woo, who, who
Woo, who, who
Woo, who, who
Oh, yeah
Woo woo
Woo woo

Well, I'ma write this letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's the jamminest record  
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven, I gotta hear it again today

You know, my temperature's risin'
And the jukebox blown a fuse
My heart's beatin' rhythm
And my soul keeps on singin' the blues
Roll over Beethoven, tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got the rockin' pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I've got the rollin' arthritis
And now had a rhythm review
Roll over Beethoven, they rockin' in two by two. 

Well, if you feel, like it
Go get your lover, then reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up just a
Trifle further, then reel and rock it
Wind another
Roll over Beethoven, dig these rhythm and blues, wah

Yeah, roll over in the mornin' and give him a warnin'
Won't you step on my high heel boots?
Oh damn diddle, I am playin' my fiddle
Ain't got nothin' to lose
Roll over Beethoven, tell Tchaikovsky the news

You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinnin' top
She got a crazy partner
Ya oughta see 'em reel and rock
Long as she got a dime the music will never stop

Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, dig these rhythm and blues

Baby here I stand before you 
With my heart in my hand 
I put it to you mama 
Hoping that you'll understand 

Oh, baby 
Mama, please don't dog me 'round 
Yeah, I would rather love you, baby 
Than anyone else I know in town 

This is my confession, mama 
And it's sung by all your song 
It proves that I'm in heaven, mama 
When you hold me in your arms 

Well, baby 
Can I have you for myself 
Yeah, if I can't have you, baby 
I don't want nobody else 

Well, baby 
Don't you want a man like me 
Well, baby 
Don't you want a man like me 
Yeah, think about your future, baby 
Forget about your used to be

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a new born baby it just happens ev'ry day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facin' up, when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you

If I look hard enough into the settin' sun
My love will laugh with me before the mornin' comes

I was born in a cross-fire hurricane
And I howled at the morning driving rain
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right. I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag,
I was schooled with a strap right across my back
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled , yeah yeah
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I was crowned with a spike right through my head
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas

I saw her today at the reception 
A glass of wine in her hand 
I knew she would meet her connection 
At her feet was her footloose man 

No, you can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
But if you try sometime you find 
You get what you need 

We went down to the demonstration 
To get your fair share of abuse 
Singing, "We're gonna vent our frustration 
If we don't we're gonna blow a fifty-amp fuse" 

You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
But if you try sometimes well you just might find 
You get what you need 

I went down to the Chelsea drugstore 
To get your prescription filled 
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy 
And man, did he look pretty ill 
We decided that we would have a soda 
My favorite flavor, cherry red 
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy 
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "dead" 
I said to him 

You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
But if you try sometimes you just might find 
You get what you need 

You get what you need--yeah, oh baby 

I saw her today at the reception 
In her glass was a bleeding man 
She was practiced at the art of deception 
Well I could tell by her blood-stained hands 

You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
But if you try sometimes you just might find 
You just might find 
You get what you need 

You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
You can't always get what you want 
But if you try sometimes you just might find 
You just might find 
You get what you need

When the phone rings 
It's just some friends of mine that say, 

"Hey, what's the matter man?

With some Puerto Rican girls that are just dyin' to meet you.

I've been walking in Central Park 
Singing after dark 
People think I'm crazy 
I've been stumbling on my feet 
Shuffling through the street 
Asking people, "What's the matter with you boy?" 
Sometimes I want to say to myself 
Sometimes I say 

Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

Fooling on my time

When I come home baby
And I've been working all night long
I put my daughter on my knee, and she says
"Daddy what's wrong?"
I put my head on her shoulder
She whispers in my ear so sweet
You know what she says?
"Daddy you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why"

You know, I got a woman
And she lives in the poor part of town
And I go see her sometimes
And we make love, so fine
I put my head on her shoulder
She says, "Tell me all your troubles"
You know what she says? 
She says, "Daddy you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why"

Daddy you're a fool to cry
Oh, I love you so much baby
Daddy you're a fool to cry
Daddy you're a fool to cry, yeah
She says, "Daddy you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why"

She says, "Daddy you're a fool to cry
Daddy you're a fool to cry
Daddy you're a fool to cry
Daddy you're a fool to cry

Even my friends say to me sometimes
And make out like I don't understand them
You know what they say?
They say, "Daddy you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why"

I'm a fool baby

Now look what you've done 
Now look what you've done 
Look what you've done baby 
Now look what you've done 
You left me here 
The lonely one 
And all I can say 
Is look what you've done 

A broken heart 
A worried mind 
Because of you baby 
Dying all the time 
I once had a dream 
But now I've none 
Your taking your love 
And see what it done 

I saw you last night 
Out moving round 
With your new turf 
You paint the town 
That is OK 
You're having your fun 
Because some day 
They call you done 

And now your bird cries 
The shadow falls 
Gloomy memories 
And I recall 
Your love is my life 
As warm as the sun 
But now it is gone 
And see what it done

Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul to waste

And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain

I rode a tank
Held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
Ah, what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah
(Woo woo, woo woo)

I watched with glee
While your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the gods they made
(Woo woo, woo woo)

I shouted out,
Who killed the Kennedys?
When after all
It was you and me
(Who who, who who)

Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reached Bombay
(Woo woo, who who)

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
(Who who)
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby
(Who who, who who)

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's confusing you
Is just the nature of my game
(Woo woo, who who)

Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails
Just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
(Who who, who who)

So if you meet me
Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
(Woo woo)
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, mm yeah
(Woo woo, woo woo)

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, mm yeah
(Who who)
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, mm mean it, get down
(Woo woo, woo woo)

Woo, who
Oh yeah, get on down
Oh yeah
Oh yeah!
(Woo woo)

Tell me baby, what's my name
Tell me honey, can ya guess my name
Tell me baby, what's my name
I tell you one time, you're to blame

Oh, who
Woo, woo
Woo, who
Woo, woo
Woo, who, who
Woo, who, who
Oh, yeah

What's my name
Tell me, baby, what's my name
Tell me, sweetie, what's my name

Woo, who, who
Woo, who, who
Woo, who, who
Woo, who, who
Woo, who, who
Woo, who, who
Oh, yeah
Woo woo
Woo woo

One, two
One, two, three, four

There's a new guy in town 
He's been dragging around 
He's the figure of youth 
And his eyes are so blue 
And they're looking at you 
So tell me the truth 

Well, well he's got stories to tell 
He bites off more than he chews 
Well, well, is he ringing your bell?
My heart is breaking in two 

And his skin is so fair 
And it shines like his hair 
As he stands so aloof 
With an indolent air 
And an insolent stare 
He just shutters the truth 

Well, well is he ringing your bell?
My heart is breaking in two 
Well, well he'll be rotting in hell 
For playing the devil with you 

Is it already too late?
And no point shutting the gate 
Have you already swallowed the bait?
And you're gone 

As he knocks you down cold 
As you lose all control 
To this slip of a youth 
I see fire in his eyes 
I see ice in his smile 
And I'm learning the truth 

Well, well he's got stories to tell 
Of love that is long overdue 
Well, well who is under his spell 
Is paying the devil his due

Angie, Angie
When will those dark clouds all disappear
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here
With no lovin' in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
Angie, Angie

You can't say we never tried
Angie, you're beautiful
But ain't it time we say goodbye
Angie, I still love you
Remember all those nights we cried
All the dreams were held so close
Seemed to all go up in smoke
Let me whisper in your ear
Angie, Angie

Where will it lead us from here
Oh, Angie, don't you wish
Oh your kisses still taste sweet
I hate that sadness in your eyes
But Angie
Angie
Ain't it time we said goodbye

With no lovin' in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
Angie, I still love you baby
Everywhere I look I see your eyes
There ain't a woman that comes close to you
Come on baby dry your eyes
Angie, Angie ain't good to be alive
Angie, Angie, we can't say we never tried

She comes in colors ev'rywhere
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming, colors in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colors

She comes in colors ev'rywhere
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming, colors in the air
Oh, everywhere

Have you seen her dressed in blue?
See the sky in front of you
And her face is like a sail
Speck of white so fair and pale
Have you seen a lady fairer?

She comes in colors ev'rywhere
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming, colors in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colors

Have you seen her all in gold?
Like a queen in days of old

Well I never kept a dollar past sunset,
It always burned a hole in my pants.
Never made a school mama happy,
Never blew a second chance, oh no

I need a love to keep me happy,
I need a love to keep me happy.
Baby, baby keep me happy.
Baby, baby keep me happy.

Always took candy from strangers,
Didn't wanna get me no trade.
Never want to be like papa,
Working for the boss ev'ry night and day.

I need a love to keep me happy,
I need a love, baby won't ya keep me happy.
Baby, won't ya keep me happy.
Baby, please keep me

I need a love to keep me happy,
I need a love to keep me happy.
Baby, baby keep me happy.
Baby

Never got a flash out of cocktails,
When I got some flesh off the bone.
Never got a lift out of Lear jets,
When I can fly way back home.

I need a love to keep me happy,
I need a love to keep me happy.
Baby, baby keep me happy.
Baby, baby keep me happy.
Baby

Happy, baby won't you keep me
Happy, baby won't you keep me
Happy, baby won't you keep me
Happy, baby won't you keep me
Happy, baby won't you keep me
Happy, baby won't you keep me
Happy, baby won't you keep me

'Cause summer's here and the time is right for fighting in the street, boy 
Well what can a poor boy do 
Except to sing for a rock 'n' roll band 
'Cause in sleepy London town 
There's just no place for a street fighting man 
No 

Hey! Think the time is right for a palace revolution 
'Cause where I live the game to play is compromise solution 
Well, then what can a poor boy do 
Except to sing for a rock 'n' roll band 
'Cause in sleepy London town 
There's just no place for a street fighting man 
No

There's just no place for a street fighting man 
No

Little Indian girl, where is your mama? 
Little Indian girl, where is your papa? 
He's fighting in the war in the streets of Masaya 
All the children were dead, except for the girl who said 

"Please Mister Gringo, please find my father"

Life just goes on and on getting harder and harder 
Little Indian girl, from Nueva, Granada

They're shooting down planes with their M-16 and with laughter

Last piece of meat was eaten by the soldiers that raped her 
All the children were dead, except for the girl who said

Waiting for a girl who's got curlers in her hair
Waiting for a girl she has no money anywhere
We get buses everywhere
Waiting for a factory girl

Waiting for a girl and her knees are much too fat
Waiting for a girl who wears scarves instead of hats
Her zipper's broken down the back
Waiting for a factory girl

Waiting for a girl and she gets me into fights
Waiting for a girl we get drunk on Friday night
She's a sight for sore eyes
Waiting for a factory girl

Waiting for a girl and she's got stains all down her dress
Waiting for a girl and my feet are getting wet
She ain't come out yet
Waiting for a factory girl

The spark (stars) in your eyes sets
my soul on fire
Your voice is like an angels above
The touch of your hand drives me insane
But baby, I want to be loved 

I'm crazy 'bout every little thing you do
I cherish the way you hug (me)
Your kiss is so sweet, honey, it can't be beat
But baby, I want to be loved 

Every time I ask you for a date
You don't come at all, or you're mighty late
I ask you to dance, (take) a little spin
You say "Wait a minute, daddy,
here comes my friend" 

I love the way you walk when you pass me by
Even when you try to snub (me)
You kill (kiss) me, baby when
you give me the eye
But baby, I want to be loved

Have you seen your mother, baby, standing in the shadow
Have you had another, baby, standing in the shadow?
I'm glad I opened your eyes
The have nots have tried to freeze you in ice

Have you seen your brother, baby, standing in the shadow
Have you had another baby, standing in the shadow
I was just passing the time
I'm all alone, won't you give all your sympathy to mine

Tell me a story about how you adore me
Live in the shadow, see through the shadow,
Live through the shadow, tear at the shadow
Hate in the shadow, and love in your shadowy life

Have you seen your lover, baby, standing in the shadow
Has he had another baby, standing in the shadow
Baby, where have you been all your life
Talking about all the people who should try anything twice

Have you seen your mother, baby, standing in the shadow
Have you had another baby, standing in the shadow
You take your choice at this time
The brave old world or the slide to the depths of decline

You ask me to give up the hand of the girl I love 
You tell me I'm not the man she's worthy of 
But who are you to tell her who to love? 
That's up to her, yes, and the Lord above 
You better move on 

Well I know you can buy her fancy clothes and diamond rings 
But I believe she's happy with me without those things 
Still you beg me to set her free 
But my friend, that will never be 
You better move on 

Now I don't blame you for lovin' her 
But can't you understand? Man, she's my girl 
And I, I'm never never ever gonna let her go 
'Cause I, yeah, I love her so 

Well I think you better go now, I'm gettin' mighty mad 
You ask me to give up the only love I've ever had 
Maybe I would, oh, but I love her so 
I'm never gonna let her go 
You better move on (you better move on)
Yeah, you better move on (you better move on)
Yeah, you better move on (you better move on)
Yeah, you better move on

Did you hear about the midnight rambler
Everybody got to go
Did you hear about the midnight rambler
The one that shut the kitchen door
He don't give a hoot of warning
Wrapped up in a black cat cloak
He don't go in the light of the morning
He split the time the cock'rel crows

Talkin' about the midnight gambler
The one you never seen before
Talkin' about the midnight gambler
Did you see him jump the garden wall
Sighin' down the wind so sadly
Listen and you'll hear him moan
Talkin' about the midnight gambler
Everybody got to go
Yeah

Did you hear about the midnight rambler
Well, honey, it's no rock 'n' roll show
Well, I'm talkin' about the midnight gambler
Yeah, the one you never seen before

(Don't you do that)

Well you heard about the Boston,
It's not one of those
Well, talkin' 'bout the midnight, sh,
The one that closed the bedroom door
I'm called the hit-and-run raper in anger
The knife-sharpened tippie-toe...
Or just the shoot 'em dead, brainbell jangler
You know, the one you never seen before

So if you ever meet the midnight rambler
Coming down your marble hall
Well he's pouncing like a proud black panther
Well, you can say I, I told you so
Well, don't you listen for the midnight rambler
Play it easy, as you go
I'm gonna smash down all your plate glass windows
Put a fist, put a fist through your steel-plated door

Did you hear about the midnight rambler
He'll leave his footprints up and down your hall
And did you hear about the midnight gambler
And did you see me make my midnight call

And if you ever catch the midnight rambler
I'll steal your mistress from under your nose
I'll go easy with your cold fanged anger
I'll stick my knife right down your throat, baby and it hurts!

I'm shattered, I'm shattered
Love and hope and sex and dreams
Are still survivin' on the street
Look at me, I'm in tatters
I'm a shattered, shattered

Friends are so alarmin' and my lover's never charmin'
Life's just a cocktail party on the street
Big Apple, people dressed in plastic bags
Directin' traffic, some kind of fashion

Laughter, joy and loneliness
And sex and sex and sex and sex

But I lost my faith in the world
Honey, when I lost you

Remember the good times we've had together
Don't you want them back again
Though these hard times are bugging me now
Honey, now it's a sin

Or it won't get very far
Well, trust in someone
Or there's gonna be war

Ev'ry time I'm walking all down the street
Some pretty mama start breaking down on me.
Stop breaking down, baby, please, stop breaking down.
Stuff is gonna bust you brains out, baby,
Gonna make you lose your mind.

You Saturday night women, now, you just ape and clown,
You don't do nothing but tear my reputation down.
Stop breaking down, mama, please, stop breaking down.
Stuff is gonna bust you brains out, baby,
Yeah, it's gonna make you lose your mind.

I love my baby ninety nine degrees,
But that mama got a pistol, laid it down on me.
Stop breaking down, baby, please, stop breaking down.
Stuff is gonna bust you brains out, baby,
Yeah, gonna make you lose your mind.

Ev'ry time I'm walking all down the street
Some pretty woman start breaking down on me.
Stop breaking down, mama, please, stop breaking down.
Stuff is gonna bust your brains out, baby,
Gonna make you lose your mind.

Sun turnin' 'round with graceful motion
We're setting off with soft explosion
Bound for a star with fiery oceans
It's so very lonely, you're a hundred light years from home

Freezing red deserts turn to dark
Energy here in every part
It's so very lonely, you're six hundred light years from home

It's so very lonely, you're a thousand light years from home
It's so very lonely, you're a thousand light years from home

Bell flight fourteen you now can land
Seen you on Aldebaran, safe on the green desert sand
It's so very lonely, you're two thousand light years from home
It's so very lonely, you're two thousand light years from home

Tried to trail you last night, baby
trail you in my car 
But I was afraid of what I was looking for 
And little by little I'm losin' my love for you 
Yeah, little by little I've found out you was untrue 

Alright, Keith, come on, now 

Well I try not to bear the buzz, a girl's gonna hitch a ride 
Things ain't been the same since my mother died 
Yeah, little by little, I'm losin' my love for you 
Yeah, little by little I've found out you was untrue (let's get out of here)

Mmm yeah! (Woo, woo)
Women think I'm tasty, but they're always tryin' to waste me
Make me burn the candle right down
But, baby, baby, don't need no jewels in my crown

'Cause all you women is low down gamblers
Cheatin' like I don't know how
Baby, got no flavor, fever in the funk house now
This low down bitchin' got my poor feet a itchin'
Don't you know you know the duece is still wild

Baby, I can't stay, you got to roll me
And call me the tumblin' dice
Always in a hurry, I never stop to worry
Don't you see the time flashin' by

Honey, got no money
I'm all sixes and sevens and nines
Say now baby, I'm the rank outsider
You can be my partner in crime

Baby, I can't stay
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin'
Roll me and call me the tumblin' dice
Now baby

I'm a ghost
Living in a ghost town
I'm a ghost
Living in a ghost town

You can look for me
But I can't be found
You can search for me
I had to go underground
Life was so beautiful
Then we all got locked down
Feel a like ghost
Living in a ghost town, yeah

Once this place was humming
And the air was full of drumming
The sound of cymbals crashing
Glasses were all smashing
Trumpets were all screaming
Saxophones were blaring
Nobody was caring if it's day or night

Whoa, oh, whoa, oh

I'm a ghost
Living in a ghost town
I'm going nowhere
Shut up all alone

So much time to lose
Just staring at my phone

Every night I am dreaming
That you'll come and creep in my bed
Please let this be over
Not stuck in a world without end

Whoa, oh, whoa, oh
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh

Preachers were all preaching
Charities beseeching
Politicians dealing
Thieves were happy stealing
Widows were all weeping
There's no beds for us to sleep in
Always had the feeling
It will all come tumbling down

I'm a ghost
Living in a ghost town
You can look for me
But I can't be found

Whoa, oh
We're all living in a ghost town
Whoa, oh
Oh, living in a ghost town
Whoa, oh
We were so beautiful
Whoa, oh
I was your man about town
Whoa, oh
Living in this ghost town
Whoa, oh
Ain't having any fun
Whoa, oh
If I want a party
Whoa, oh
It's a party of one
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh

But he ain't talkin' about it any more
Is he, Claudine? 

There's blood in the chalet
And blood in the snow
(She)Washed her hands of the whole damn show
The best thing you could do, Claudine 

Shot him once right through the head
Shot him twice right through the chest
The judge says (ruled) it was an accident
Claudine
Accidents will happen
(In the best homes) 

And Claudine's back in jail again

I always leave the safety on
I recommend it
Claudine 

Now she pistol whipped me once or twice
But she never tried to take my life
(What do you think about that)
Claudine 

The prettiest girl I ever seen
I saw you on the movie screen
Hope you don't try to make a sacrifice of me
Claudine

Don't wave a gun at me

Hannah baby was a peachy kind of girl
Her eyes were hazel and her nose were slightly curved
We spent a lonely night at the memory motel
It's on the ocean, I guess you know it well
It took one starry night to steal my heart away
Out on the water front, her hair all drenched in spray

Hannah baby was a honey of a girl
Her eyes were hazel and her teeth were slightly curved
She took my guitar, she began to play
She sang a song for me and it stuck right in my heart

You're just a memory
Of a love that used to be
You're just a memory
Of a love that used to mean so much to me

She got a mind of her own
And she use it well, yes she does
She got a mind of her own
And she use it, she used it mighty fine, yeah

She drove a pick-up truck painted green and blue
The tires were wearing thin, she turned a mile or two
When I asked her where she's headed for
"Back up to Boston, I'm singing in a bar"

And you're just a memory
Of a love that used to be
You're just a memory
Of a love that used to mean so much to me

She got a mind, she got a mind of her own
And she used it mighty fine, yes she does, oh yeah
She got a mind of her own
And she used it well

On the seventh day, my eyes were all a glaze
We've been ten thousand miles, I've been to fifteen states
Every woman seemed to fade out of my mind
I hit the bottle and I hit the sack and cried

What's all this laughter on the 22nd floor?
It's just some friends of mine and they're busting down the door
Been a lonely night at the memory motel
Oh yes it is

You're just a memory
Of a love that used to be
You're just a memory
Of a love that used to mean so much to me

Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la

You're just a memory
Of a love that used to be
You're just a memory
Of a love that used to mean so much to me, oh yeah

She got a mind of her own
And she used it well, yes she does, oh yeah
She got a mind of her own
And she used it mighty fine

Did you hear about the midnight rambler
Everybody got to go
Did you hear about the midnight rambler
The one that shut the kitchen door
He don't give a hoot of warning
Wrapped up in a black cat cloak
He don't go in the light of the morning
He split the time the cock'rel crows

Talkin' about the midnight gambler
The one you never seen before
Talkin' about the midnight gambler
Did you see him jump the garden wall
Sighin' down the wind so sadly
Listen and you'll hear him moan
Talkin' about the midnight gambler
Everybody got to go
Yeah

Did you hear about the midnight rambler
Well, honey, it's no rock 'n' roll show
Well, I'm talkin' about the midnight gambler
Yeah, the one you never seen before

(Don't you do that)

Well you heard about the Boston,
It's not one of those
Well, talkin' 'bout the midnight, sh,
The one that closed the bedroom door
I'm called the hit-and-run raper in anger
The knife-sharpened tippie-toe...
Or just the shoot 'em dead, brainbell jangler
You know, the one you never seen before

So if you ever meet the midnight rambler
Coming down your marble hall
Well he's pouncing like a proud black panther
Well, you can say I, I told you so
Well, don't you listen for the midnight rambler
Play it easy, as you go
I'm gonna smash down all your plate glass windows
Put a fist, put a fist through your steel-plated door

Did you hear about the midnight rambler
He'll leave his footprints up and down your hall
And did you hear about the midnight gambler
And did you see me make my midnight call

And if you ever catch the midnight rambler
I'll steal your mistress from under your nose
I'll go easy with your cold fanged anger
I'll stick my knife right down your throat, baby and it hurts!

You don't know what's going on 
You've been away for far too long 
You can't come back and think you are still mine 
You're out of touch, my baby 
My poor discarded baby 
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 

Well, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 
You are all left out 
Out of there without a doubt 
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 

A girl who wants to run away, discovers that she's had her day
It's no good thinking that you are still mine
You're out of touch, my baby, my poor unfaithful baby
I said baby, baby, baby you're out of time

Well, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 
You are all left out 
Out of there without a doubt 
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 

You thought you were a clever girl giving up your social whirl
But you can't come back and be the first in line
You're obsolete, my baby, my poor old fashioned baby
I said baby, baby, baby you're out of time

Well, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 
Yes, you are all left out 
Out of there without a doubt 
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

I can't get no satisfaction, I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm drivin' in my car, and the man come on the radio
He's tellin' me more and more about some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination

I can't get no, oh, no, no, no, hey, hey, hey
That's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction, I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm watchin' my tv and a man comes on and tell me
How white my shirts can be
But, he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me

I was born in a cross-fire hurricane
And I howled at the morning driving rain
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right. I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag,
I was schooled with a strap right across my back
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled , yeah yeah
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I was crowned with a spike right through my head
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas

Childhood living is easy to do
The things you wanted I bought them for you
Graceless lady you know who I am
You know I can't let you slide through my hands

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away

I watched you suffer a dull aching pain
Now you've decided to show me the same
No sweeping exit or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away
I know I've dreamed you a sin and a lie
I have my freedom but I don't have much time
Faith has been broken tears must be cried
Let's do some living after we die

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses we'll ride them some day
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses we'll ride them some day

Did you hear about the midnight rambler 
Everybody got to go 
Did you hear about the midnight rambler 
The one that shut the kitchen door 
He don't give a hoot of warning 
Wrapped up in a black cat cloak 
He don't go in the light of the morning 
He split the time the cock'rel crows 

Talkin' about the midnight gambler 
The one you never seen before 
Talkin' about the midnight gambler 
Did you see him jump the garden wall 
Sighin' down the wind so sadly 
Listen and you'll hear him moan 
Talkin' about the midnight gambler 
Everybody got to go 
Yeah

Did you hear about the midnight rambler 
Well, honey, it's no rock 'n' roll show 
Well, I'm talkin' about the midnight gambler 
Yeah, the one you never seen before 

(Don't you do that) 
  
Well you heard about the Boston,
It's not one of those 
Well, talkin' 'bout the midnight, sh,
The one that closed the bedroom door 
I'm called the hit-and-run raper in anger 
The knife-sharpened tippie-toe... 
Or just the shoot 'em dead, brainbell jangler 
You know, the one you never seen before 

So if you ever meet the midnight rambler 
Coming down your marble hall 
Well he's pouncing like a proud black panther 
Well, you can say I, I told you so 
Well, don't you listen for the midnight rambler 
Play it easy, as you go 
I'm gonna smash down all your plate glass windows 
Put a fist, put a fist through your steel-plated door 

Did you hear about the midnight rambler 
He'll leave his footprints up and down your hall 
And did you hear about the midnight gambler 
And did you see me make my midnight call 

And if you ever catch the midnight rambler 
I'll steal your mistress from under your nose 
I'll go easy with your cold fanged anger 
I'll stick my knife right down your throat, baby and it hurts!

I've been holding out so long 
I've been sleeping all alone 
Lord I miss you 
I've been hanging on the phone 
I've been sleeping all alone 
I want to kiss you 

Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh 

Well, I've been haunted in my sleep 
You've been staring in my dreams 
Lord I miss you
I've been waiting in the hall 
Been waiting on your call 
When the phone rings 
It's just some friends of mine that say
Hey, what's the matter man? 
We're gonna come around at twelve 
With some puerto rican girls that are just dyin' to meet you 
We're gonna bring a case of wine 
Hey, let's go mess and fool around 
You know, like we used to

Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah 
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah 

Oh baby why you wait so long 
Oh baby why you wait so long 
Won't you come on come on

I've been walking central park 
Singing after dark 
People think I'm crazy 
I've been stumbling on my feet 
Shuffling through the street 
Ask me people, what's the matter with you boy?

Sometimes I want to say to myself 
Sometimes I say 

Oooh oooh oooh oooh I won't miss you child 

I guess I'm lying to myself 
It's just you and no one else 
Lord I won't miss you child 

Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah 
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah 
Lord, I miss you child 

Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah 
Yeah, I miss you child
Aaah aaah aaah aaah
