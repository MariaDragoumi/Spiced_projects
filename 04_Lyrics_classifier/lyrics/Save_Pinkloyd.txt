Following the path as it leads toward
The darkness in the north
Weary stranger's faces show their sympathy
They've seen that hope before

And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
For you the night is beckoning
And now you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
And you must you realize be on your way

Mystery swelling, creatures crawling
Hear the roar Jer louder in your ears
You know the folly was your own
But the force behind can't conquer all you fears

And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
For you the night is beckoning and you know
And now you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
And you must you realize be on your way

Throw your thoughts back many years
To the time when love was life with every morning
Perhaps a day will come when the match 
For me the curlers past warning

And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
For you the night is beckoning
And now you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
And you must you realize be on your way

Bring the boys back home
Bring the boys back home
Don't leave the children on their own, no, no
Bring the boys back home

Wrong, do it again
Time to go
Are you feeling okay?
There's a man answering, but he keeps hanging up

Is there anybody out there?

F*ck all that we've got to get on with these 
Gotta compete with the wily Japanese
There's too many home fires burning 
And not enough trees
So f*ck all that 
We've go to get on with these

Can't stop!
Lose job! 
Mind gone!
Silicon! 
What bomb?
Get away! 
Pay day!
Make hay! 
Break down! 
Need fix. 
Big six. 
Clickity click. 
Hold on! 
Oh no, 
Bring bingo! 

Make 'em laugh 
Make 'em cry 
Make 'em dance in the aisles 
Make 'em pay 
Make 'em stay 
Make 'em feel okay 

Not nah John 
We've got to get on with the film show
Hollywood waits at the end of the rainbow
Who cares what it's about 
As long as the kids go? 
Not now John we've
Got to get on with the show

Hang on John I've got to get on with this
I don't know what it is 
But it fits on here like
Come at the end of the shift
We'll go and get pissed
Not now John 
I've got to get on with this 

Hold on John 
I think there's something good on 
I used to read books but
It could be the news 
Or some other amusement
It could be reusable shows 

F*ck all that we've got to get on with these 
Got to compete with the wily Japanese
No need to worry about the Vietnamese
Got to bring the Russian Bear to his knees 
Well, maybe not the Russian Bear 
Maybe the Swedes
We showed Argentina 
Now let's go and show these
Make us feel tough 
And wouldn't Maggie be pleased? 
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah! 

S'cusi dove il bar 
(What?) 
Se para collo pou eine toe bar 
s'il vous plait ou est le bar 
(Say it in English!) 
Oi, where's the fucking bar John? 
(Oh, now you're talking!)\" 
Oh! Rule Britannia! Britannia rules the day 
Down! 
Go, Maggie! 
Hammer, Hammer, Hammer, Hammer, now!

Heaven sent the promised land
Looks alright from where I stand
'Cause I'm the man on the outside looking in

Waiting on the first step
Show me where the key is kept
Point me down the right line because it's time

To let me in from the cold
Turn my lead into gold
'Cause there's a chill wind blowing in my soul
And I think I'm growing old

Flash the readies
What's, uh the deal?
Got to make it to the next meal
Try to keep up with the turning of the wheel

Mile after mile (mile after mile)
Stone after stone (stone after stone)
you turn to speak but you're alone
Million miles from home, you're on your own

So let me in from the cold
Turn my lead into gold
'Cause there's a chill wind blowing in my soul
And I think I'm growing old

Fire bright by candlelight
And her by my side
And if she prefers we will never stir again

Someone sent the promised land
And I grabbed it with both hands
Now I'm the man on the inside looking out

Hear me shout "Come on in,
What's the news and where you been?"
'Cause there's no wind left in my soul
And I've grown old

Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave but don't leave me
Look around, choose your own ground
For long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all your touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be

Run, rabbit run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one
For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave

Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
You better make your face up in
Your favorite disguise
With your button down lips and your
Roller blind eyes
With your empty smile
And your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters
When the conch shell shatters
And the hammers batter
Down your door
You'd better run

Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
You better run all day
And run all night
Keep your dirty feelings
Deep inside
And if you're taking your girlfriend
Out tonight
You'd better park the car
Well out of sight
'Cause if they catch you in the back seat
Trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to mother
In a cardboard box
You better run

"Hey, open up!"
"Hammer, hammer"

Money, get away
Get a good job with good pay and you're okay
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four star daydream
Think I'll buy me a football team

Money, get back
I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack
Money, it's a hit
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity first class traveling set
And I think I need a Lear jet

Money, it's a crime
Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a raise it's no surprise that they're
Giving none away, away, away

Icy wind of night, be gone
This is not your domain
In the sky a bird was heard to cry
Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds
Belied a deathly silence that lay all around
Hear the lark and harken
To the barking of the dog-fox gone to ground
See the splashing of the King-fisher
Flashing to the water
River of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer
Making for the sea

In the lazy water meadow I lay me down
All around me, golden sun flakes covering the ground
Lazing in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday in to my city room
Hear the lark and harken
To the barking of the dog-fox gone to ground
See the splashing of the King-fisher
Flashing to the water
River of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer
Making for the sea

In the lazy water meadow
I lay me down
All around me,
Golden sun flakes settling on the ground,
Basking in the sunshine of a by gone afternoon,
Bringing sounds of yesterday into my city room
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
River of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees,
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer making for the sea

I've been mad for fucking years, absolutely years, 
Been over the edge for yonks, 
Been working me buns off for bands 

I've always been mad, I know I've been mad, 
Like the most of us, very hard to explain why you're mad, 
Even if you're not mad

Welcome my son, welcome to the machine
Where have you been?
It's alright we know where you've been
You've been in the pipeline, filling in time
Provided with toys and 'scouting for boys'
You brought a guitar to punish your ma
And you didn't like school, and you
Know you're nobody's fool
So welcome to the machine

Welcome my son, welcome to the machine
What did you dream?
It's alright we told you what to dream
You dreamed of a big star
He played a mean guitar
He always ate in the Steak Bar
He loved to drive in his Jaguar
So welcome to the machine

Big man, pig man
Ha, ha, charade you are
You well heeled big wheel
Ha, ha, charade you are
And when your hand is on your heart
You're nearly a good laugh
Almost a joker
With your head down in the pig bin
Saying 'Keep on digging'
Pig stain on your fat chin
What do you hope to find
Down in the pig mine?
You're nearly a laugh
You're nearly a laugh
But you're really a cry

Bus stop rat bag
Ha, ha, charade you are
You fucked up old hag
Ha, ha, charade you are
You radiate cold shafts of broken glass
You're nearly a good laugh
Almost worth a quick grin
You like the feel of steel
You're hot stuff with a hatpin
And good fun with a hand gun
You're nearly a laugh
You're nearly a laugh
But you're really a cry

Hey you, Whitehouse
Ha, ha, charade you are
You house proud town mouse
Ha, ha, charade you are
You're trying to keep our feelings off the street
You're nearly a real treat
All tight lips and cold feet
And do you feel abused?
You got to stem the evil tide
And keep it all on the inside
Mary you're nearly a treat
Mary you're nearly a treat
But you're really a cry

It's awfully considerate of you to think of me here 
And I'm much obliged to you for making it clear 
That I'm not here. 
And I never knew we could be so thick 
And I never knew the moon could be so blue 
And I'm grateful that you threw away my old shoes 
And brought me here instead dressed in red 
And I'm wondering who could be writing this song. 

I don't care if the sun don't shine 
And I don't care if nothing is mine 
And I don't care if I'm nervous with you 
I'll do my loving in the winter. 

And the sea isn't green 
And I love the queen 
And what exactly is a dream 
And what exactly is a joke.

Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
Snapshot in the family album
Daddy what else did you leave for me?
Daddy, what'd'ja leave behind for me?
All in all it was just a brick in the wall
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall

Oh, my girl sitting in the sky
Go buy candy and a currant bun
I like to see you run
Lay back

Don't talk to me
Please, just f*ck with me
Please, you know I'm feeling frail

It's true, sun shining very bright
It's you, I'm gonna love tonight
Ice cream tastes good in the afternoon
Ice cream tastes good if you eat it soon

Don't touch me child
Please, know you drive me wild
Please you know, I'm feeling frail

Don't try another cat
Don't go where other you must know why
Very, very, very frail

Oh, my girl sitting in the sun
Go buy candy and a currant bun
I like to see you run
Like that


Ooooh, babe
Don't leave me now
Don't say it's the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent

I need you, babe
To put through the shredder
In front of my friends
Ooh babe

Don't leave me now
How could you go?
When you know how I need you
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night
Ooh babe, don't leave me now

How can you treat me this way?
Running away
Ooh babe
Why are you running away?
Ooh babe

"There is an Important announcement"
"Silence in the studio!"

(Ooh, ma, ooh, pa) must the show go on?
(Ooh, pa) take me home, take me home, take me home
(Ooh, ma) let me go

There must be some mistake
I didn't mean to let them take away my soul
Am I too old, is it too late?

(Ooh, ma, ooh, pa) where has the feeling gone?
(Ooh, ma, ooh, pa) will I remember the songs?
(Ooh, ah)
The show must go on

Momma loves her baby
And daddy loves you too.
And the sea may look warm to you babe
And the sky may look blue
Ooooh baby
Ooooh baby blue
Oooooh babe.

If you should go skating
On the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you the silent reproach
Of a million tear-stained eyes
Don't be surprised when a crack in the ice
Appears under your feet
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind
With your fear flowing out behind you
As you claw the thin ice

Arnold Layne had a strange hobby
Collecting clothes
Moonshine washing line
They suit him fine
On the wall hung a tall mirror
Distorted view, see through baby blue
Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same, takes two to know
Two to know, two to know
Why can't you see?
Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne

Now he's caught, a nasty sort of person
They gave him time
Doors bang, chain gang, he hates it
Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same, takes two to know
Two to know, two to know
Why can't you see?
Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne

Don't do it again

As I reach for a peach
Slide a rind down behind
The sofa in San Tropez
Breakin' a stick
With a brick on the sand
Ridin' a wave
In the wake of an old sedan

Sleepin' alone in the
Drone of the darkness,
Scratched by the sand that
Fell from my love,
Deep in my dreams and I
Still hear her callin'
If you're alone
I'll come home

Backward and home-bound
The pigeon, the dove
Gone with the wind
And the rain, on an airplane
Owning a home
With no silver spoon
I'm drinking champagne
Like a good tycoon

Sooner than wait for
A break in the weather,
I'll gather my far-flung
Thoughts together
Speeding away
On the wind to a new day
And if you're alone
I'll come home

And I pause for a while
By a country style
And listen to the things they say
Diggin' for gold
With a hoe in my hand
Open a book
Take a look at the way things stand

And you're leading me down
To the place by the sea
I hear your soft voice
Calling to me
Making a date for
Later by phone
And if you're alone
I'll come home

Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

You better make your face up in your favorite disguise
With your button down lips and your roller blind eyes
With your empty smile and your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters
When the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter down the door
You better run

Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

You better run all day and run all night
And keep your dirty feelings deep inside
And if you're takin' your girlfriend out tonight
You better park the car well out of sight
Cause if they catch you in the back seat
Trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to mother
In a cardboard box
You better run

I don't need no arms around me
And I don't need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall
Don't think I'll need anything at all
No, don't think I'll need anything at all
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall
All in all you were all just bricks in the wall

Welcome my son, welcome to the machine. 
Where have you been? 
It's alright we know where you've been. 
You've been in the pipeline, filling in time, 
Provided with toys and 'Scouting for Boys'. 
You brought a guitar to punish your ma, 
And you didn't like school, and you 
Know you're nobody's fool, 
So welcome to the machine. 

Welcome my son, welcome to the machine. 
What did you dream? 
It's alright we told you what to dream. 
You dreamed of a big star, 
He played a mean guitar, 
He always ate in the Steak Bar. 
He loved to drive in his Jaguar. 
So welcome to the Machine.

There was a boy whose name was Jim
His friends, they were very good to him
They gave him tea, and cakes and jam
And slices of delicious ham
Oh Mother tell me more

Why'd'you have to leave me there
Hanging in my infant air, waiting
You only have to read the lines of
Scribbly black and everything shines

The chief defect of Henry King
Was chewing little bits of string
At last he swallowed some which tied
Itself in ugly knots inside

Wondering and dreaming
The words have different meanings
Yes they did

And finding she was left alone
Went tiptoe to the telephone, 999
And summoned the immediate aid
Of London's Noble Fire Brigade

For all the time spent in that room
The doll's house darkness old perfume
And fairy stories held me high
On clouds of sunlight floating by
Oh Mother tell me more
Tell me more

"There is an Important announcement"
"Silence in the studio!"

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day 
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way. 
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town 
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way. 

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain. 
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today. 
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you. 
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun. 

So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking 
Racing around to come up behind you again. 
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older, 
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death. 

Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time. 
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines 
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way 
The time is gone, the song is over, 
Thought I'd something more to say.

Money, get away
Get a good job with good pay and you're okay
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four star daydream
Think I'll buy me a football team

Money, get back
I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack
Money, it's a hit
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity first class traveling set
And I think I need a Lear jet

Money, it's a crime
Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say

Emily tries but misunderstands, ah ooh
She's often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams till tomorrow

There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

Soon after dark Emily cries, ah ooh
Gazing through trees in sorrow hardly a sound till tomorrow

There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

Put on a gown that touches the ground, ah ooh
Float on a river forever and ever, Emily (Emily)

There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play

But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave

I've got a little black book with my poems in
Got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in
When I'm a good dog, they sometimes throw me a bone in

I got elastic bands keepin' my shoes on
Got those swollen-hand blues
I got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V. to choose from
I've got electric light
And I've got second sight
I got amazing powers of observation
And that is how I know
When I try to get through 
On the telephone to you
There'll be nobody home

I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favorite satin shirt
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
I've got a silver spoon on a chain
Got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains

I've got wild staring eyes
And I've got a strong urge to fly
But I got nowhere to fly to
Ooh, babe when I pick up the phone

(Surprise, surprise, surprise) there's still nobody home

I've got a pair of Gohills boots
But I got fading roots

['\n']

Stay! 
And help me to end the day
And if you don’t mind
We’ll break a bottle of wine
Stick around 
And maybe we’ll put one down
'Cause I wanna find 
What lies behind those eyes

Midnight blue
Burning gold
A yellow moon
Is growing cold

I rise
Looking through my morning eyes
Surprised 
To find you by my side
Rack my brain 
And try to remember your name
To find 
The words to tell you good-bye

Morning dues
Newborn day
Midnight blue
Turned to gray

Midnight blue
Burning gold
A yellow moon
Is growing cold

You know that I care
What happens to you
And I know that you care
For me too
So I don't feel alone
Or the weight of the stone
Now that I've found somewhere safe
To bury my bone
And any fool knows a dog needs a home
A shelter from pigs on the wing

Nobody knows where you are
How near or how far
Shine on you crazy diamond
Pile on many more layers
And I'll be joining you there
Shine on you crazy diamond
And we'll bask in the shadow
Of yesterday's triumph
And sail on the steel breeze
Come on you boy child
You winner and loser
Come on you miner for truth, for delusion, and shine!

I've been mad for fucking years, absolutely years, 
Been over the edge for yonks, 
Been working me buns off for bands 

I've always been mad, I know I've been mad, 
Like the most of us, very hard to explain why you're mad, 
Even if you're not mad

Emily tries but misunderstands, ah ooh
She's often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams till tomorrow

There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

Soon after dark Emily cries, ah ooh
Gazing through trees in sorrow hardly a sound till tomorrow

There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

Put on a gown that touches the ground, ah ooh
Float on a river forever and ever, Emily (Emily)

There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

Did you know, it was all going to go so wrong for you
And did you see it was all going to be so right for me
Why did we tell you then
You were always the golden boy then
And that you'd never lose that light in your eyes

Hey you, did you ever realize what you'd become
And did you see that it wasn't only me you were running from
Did you know all the time but it never bothered you anyway
Leading the blind while I stared out the steel in your eyes

The rain fell slow, down on all the roofs of uncertainty
I thought of you and the years and all the sadness fell away from me
And did you know

I never thought that you'd lose that light in your eyes

Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave but don't leave me
Look around, choose your own ground
For long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all your touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be

Run, rabbit run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one
For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave

All is love, is all I am
A ball is all I am
I'm so new compared to you
And I am very small

Warm glow, moon bloom
Always need a little more room
Waiting here seems like years
Never seen the light of day

All around I hear strange sounds
Come gurgling in my ear
Red the light and dark the night
I feel my dawn is near

Warm glow, moon bloom
Always need a little more room
Whisper low, here I go
I will see the sunshine show

Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun
Shine on you crazy diamond
Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky
Shine on you crazy diamond
You were caught on the crossfire of childhood and stardom
Blown on the steel breeze

Come on you target for faraway laughter
Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine

You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon
Shine on you crazy diamond
Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light
Shine on you crazy diamond
Well you wore out your welcome with random precision
Rode on the steel breeze

Come on you raver, you seer of visions
Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine

Remember when you were young? 
You shone like the sun. 
Shine on, you crazy diamond 
Now there's a look in your eyes 
Like black holes in the sky 
Shine on, you crazy diamond 
You were caught in the crossfire 
Of childhood and stardom, 
Blown on the steel breeze 
Come on you target 
for faraway laughter; 
Come on you stranger, you legend, 
You martyr, and shine 

You reached for the secret 
too soon 
You cried for the moon 
Shine on, you crazy diamond 
Threatened by shadows at night 
And exposed in the light 
Shine on, you crazy diamond 
Well, you wore out your welcome 
With random precision 
Rode on the steel breeze 
Come on you raver, you seer of visions; 
Come on you painter, you piper, 
You prisoner, and shine 

Nobody knows where you are, 
How near or how far 
Shine on, you crazy diamond 
Pile on many 
more layers 
And I'll be joining you there 
Shine on, you crazy diamond 
And we'll bask in the shadow 
Of yesterday's triumph 
And sail on the steel breeze 
Come on you boy child, you winner and loser, 
Come on you miner for truth and delusion, 
And shine.

"Well, only got an hour of daylight left. Better get started"
"Isn't it unsafe to travel at night?"
"It'll be a lot less safe to stay here, your father's gunna pick up our trail before long"
"Can Loca ride?"
"Yeah, I can ride, Margaret, time to go! Maigret, thank you for everything"
"Goodbye Chenga"
"Goodbye miss"
"I'll be back"

Is there anybody out there?

As you look around this room tonight 
Settle in your seat and dim the lights 
Do you want my blood  do you want my tears 
What do you want 
What do you want from me 
Should I sing until I can't sing any more 
Play these strings until my fingers are raw 
You're so hard to please 
What do you want from me 

Do you think I know something you don't know 
What do you want from me 
If I don't promise you the answers would you go 
What do you want from me 
Should I stand out in the rain 
Do you want me to make a daisy chain for you 
I'm not the one you need 
What do you want from me 

You can have anything you want 
You can drift, you can dream, even walk on water 
Anything you want

You can own everything you see 
Sell your soul for complete control 
Is that really what you need 

You can lose yourself this night 
See inside there is nothing to hide 
Turn and face the light 

What do you want from me

So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
Did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears
Wish you were here

Arnold Layne 
Had a strange hobby
Collecting clothes
Moonshine washing line
They suit him fine

On the wall 
Hung a tall mirror
Distorted view
See through baby blue
He done it, oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same, 
It takes two to know
Two to know 
Two to know
Two to know
Why can't you see?

Arnold Layne 
Arnold Layne 
Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne

Now he's caught
A nasty sort of person
They gave him time
Doors bang, chain gang 
He hates it
Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same 
It takes two to know
Two to know 
Two to know
Two to know
Why can't you see?

Arnold Layne 
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne

Arnold Layne, don't do it again

The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking

He’s haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can’t be precise
He’s chained forever to a world that’s departed
It’s not enough, it’s not enough

His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

One world, one soul
Time pass, the river roll

And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be

There’s an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there’s dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder than words
Of promises broken

['\n']

It's awfully considerate of you to think of me here 
And I'm much obliged to you for making it clear 
That I'm not here. 
And I never knew we could be so thick 
And I never knew the moon could be so blue 
And I'm grateful that you threw away my old shoes 
And brought me here instead dressed in red 
And I'm wondering who could be writing this song. 

I don't care if the sun don't shine 
And I don't care if nothing is mine 
And I don't care if I'm nervous with you 
I'll do my loving in the winter. 

And the sea isn't green 
And I love the queen 
And what exactly is a dream 
And what exactly is a joke.

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over
Thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells

Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun

Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut

There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before times took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
When friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some in a tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river

Forever and ever

['\n']

Us and them
And after all we're only ordinary men
Me and you
God only knows
It's not what we would choose to do
Forward he cried from the rear
And the front rank died
And the general sat
And the lines on the map
Moved from side to side
Black and blue
And who knows which is which and who is who
Up and down
And in the end it's only round 'n round
Haven't you heard it's a battle of words
The poster bearer cried
Listen son, said the man with the gun
There's room for you inside

"I mean, they're not gonna kill ya, so if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock, they won't do it again. Dig it? I mean he get off lightly, 'cause I would've given him a thrashing - I only hit him once! It was only a difference of opinion, but really...I mean good manners don't cost nothing do they, eh?"

Down and out
It can't be helped that there's a lot of it about
With, without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
Out of the way
It's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For the want of the price
Of tea and a slice
The old man died

Overhead the albatross
Hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves
In labyrinths of coral caves
An echo of a distant time
Comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

And no one called us to the land
And no one knows the where's or why's
Something stirs and something tries
Starts to climb toward the light

Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand
The best I can

And no one called us to the land
And no one crosses there alive
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun

Almost everyday you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me
To rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

And no one sings me lullabys
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky

The path you tread is narrow 
And the drop is shear and very high 
The ravens all are watching 
From a vantage point nearby 
Apprehension creeping 
Like a tube-train up your spine 
Will the tightrope reach the end 
Will the final couplet rhyme 

And it's high time 
Cymbaline 
It's high time 
Cymbaline 
Please wake me 

A butterfly with broken wings 
Is falling by your side 
The ravens all are closing in 
And there's nowhere you can hide 
Your manager and agent 
Are both busy on the phone 
Selling coloured photographs 
To magazines back home 

And it's high time 
Cymbaline 
It's high time 
Cymbaline 
Please wake me 

The lines converging where you stand 
They must have moved the picture plane 
The leaves are heavy around your feet 
You hear the thunder of the train 
And suddenly it strikes you 
That they're moving into range 
Doctor Strange is always changing size 

And it's high time 
Cymbaline 
It's high time 
Cymbaline 
Please wake me 

And it's high time 
Cymbaline 
It's high time 
Cymbaline 
Please wake me

For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals
Then something happenend which unleashed the power of our imagination
We learned to talk

There's a silence surrounding me
I can't seem to think straight
I'll sit in the corner
No one can bother me

I think I should speak now 
Why won't you talk to me
I can't seem to speak now 
You never talk to me

My words won't come out right 
What are you thinking
I feel like I'm drowning 
What are you feeling

I'm feeling weak now 
You never talk to me
But I can't show my weakness 

What are you thinking
I sometimes wonder 
What are you feeling

Where do we go from here

It doesn't have to be like this
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking

Why won't you talk to me 
I feel like I'm drowning
You never talk to me 
You know I can't breathe now

What are you thinking 
We're going nowhere
What are you feeling 
We're going nowhere

Why won't you talk to me
You never talk to me
What are you thinking
Where do we go from here

It doesn't have to be like this
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking

Bring the boys back home
Bring the boys back home
Don't leave the children on their own, no, no
Bring the boys back home

Wrong, do it again
Time to go
Are you feeling okay?
There's a man answering, but he keeps hanging up

Is there anybody out there?

Hello
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?

Come on, now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again

Relax
I need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

OK
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more--aaahhh!
But you may feel a little sick

Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going for the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb

Lime and limpid green, a second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down, the sound surrounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania
Neptune, Titan, Stars can frighten
Lime and limpid green, a second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down, the sound surrounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania
Neptune, Titan, Stars can frighten
Blinding signs flap,
Flicker, flicker, flicker blam, pow, pow
Stairway scare, Dan Dare, who's there?
Lime and limpid green, the sounds around
The icy waters under
Lime and limpid green, the sounds around
The icy waters underground

You gotta be crazy, you gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street
You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking

And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you,
You'll get the chance to put the knife in

You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you get older
And in the end you'll pack up and fly down south
Hide your head in the sand,
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer

And when you loose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone
Dragged down by the stone (stone, stone, stone, stone, stone)

I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?

Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable and no-one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
And everything's done under the sun
And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer

Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel

Who was fitted with collar and chain
Who was given a pat on the back
Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home

Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone

Little by little the night turns around. 
Counting the leaves which tremble and turn. 
Lotus's lean on each other in union. 
Over the hills where a swallow is resting. 
Set the controls for the heart of the sun.

Over the mountain watching the watcher. 
Breaking the darkness waking the grapevine. 
Morning to birth is born into shadow 
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine. 
Set the controls for the heart of the sun. 
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun. 

Who is the man who arrives at the wall? 
Making the shape of his questions at asking. 
Thinking the sun will fall in the evening. 
Will he remember the lesson of giving? 
Set the controls for the heart of the sun. 
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun.

Heavy hung the canopy of blue
Shade my eyes and I can see you
White was the light 
That shines through the dress that you wore

She lay in the shadow of a wave
Hazy were the visions overplayed
Sunshine in her eyes 
But moonshine made her cry everytime

Green is the colour of her kind
Quickness of the eye
Deceives the mind
Envy is the bond between
The hopefull and the damned

['\n']

Welcome my son, welcome to the machine
Where have you been?
It's alright we know where you've been
You've been in the pipeline, filling in time
Provided with toys and 'scouting for boys'
You brought a guitar to punish your ma
And you didn't like school, and you
Know you're nobody's fool
So welcome to the machine

Welcome my son, welcome to the machine
What did you dream?
It's alright we told you what to dream
You dreamed of a big star
He played a mean guitar
He always ate in the Steak Bar
He loved to drive in his Jaguar
So welcome to the machine

I turned to look but it was gone 
I cannot put my finger on it now 
The child is grown, 
The dream is gone. 
I have become comfortably numb.

"Well, only got an hour of daylight left. Better get started"
"Isn't it unsafe to travel at night?"
"It'll be a lot less safe to stay here, your father's gunna pick up our trail before long"
"Can Loca ride?"
"Yeah, I can ride, Margaret, time to go! Maigret, thank you for everything"
"Goodbye Chenga"
"Goodbye miss"
"I'll be back"

Is there anybody out there?

Arnold Layne 
Had a strange hobby
Collecting clothes
Moonshine washing line
They suit him fine

On the wall 
Hung a tall mirror
Distorted view
See through baby blue
He done it, oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same, 
It takes two to know
Two to know 
Two to know
Two to know
Why can't you see?

Arnold Layne 
Arnold Layne 
Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne

Now he's caught
A nasty sort of person
They gave him time
Doors bang, chain gang 
He hates it
Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same 
It takes two to know
Two to know 
Two to know
Two to know
Why can't you see?

Arnold Layne 
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne

Arnold Layne, don't do it again

Marigolds are very much in love, but he doesn’t mind
Picking up his sister, he makes his way into the seas or land
All the way
She smiles

She goes up while he goes down, down

Sits on a stick in the river
Laughter in his sleep
Sister’s throwing stones, hoping for a hit
He doesn’t know so then

She goes up while he goes down, down

Another time, ah
Another day, ah
A brother’s way to leave
Another time, ah
Another day, ah

She’ll be selling plastic flowers on a Sunday afternoon
Picking up weeds, she hasn’t got the time to care
All can see he’s not there

She grows up for another man, and he’s down

Another time, ah, another day, ah
A brother’s way to leave
Another time, ah, another day
Another time, ah, another day, ah
A brother’s way to leave

Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun
Shine on you crazy diamond
Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky
Shine on you crazy diamond
You were caught on the crossfire of childhood and stardom
Blown on the steel breeze

Come on you target for faraway laughter
Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine

You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon
Shine on you crazy diamond
Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light
Shine on you crazy diamond
Well you wore out your welcome with random precision
Rode on the steel breeze

Come on you raver, you seer of visions
Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine

All that you touch
And all that you see
All that you taste
All you feel
And all that you love
And all that you hate
All you distrust
All you save
And all that you give
And all that you deal
And all that you buy
Beg, borrow or steal
And all you create
And all you destroy
And all that you do
And all that you say
And all that you eat
And everyone you meet (everyone you meet)
And all that you slight
And everyone you fight
And all that is now
And all that is gone
And all that's to come
And everything under the sun is in tune
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain.
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you.
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.

So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again.
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older,
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.

Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time.
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over,
Thought I'd something more to say.

Home
Home again
I like to be here
When I can

When I come home
Cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones
Beside the fire

Far away
Across the field
Tolling on the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spell

All that you touch
All that you see
All that you taste
All you feel
All that you love
All that you hate
All you distrust
All you save
All that you give
All that you deal
All that you buy
Beg, borrow or steal
All you create
All you destroy
All that you do
All that you say
All that you eat
And everyone you meet
All that you slight
And everyone you fight
All that is now
All that is gone
All that's to come
And everything under the sun is in tune
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon

Mother do you think they'll drop the bomb? 

Mother do you think they'll like this song? 

Mother do you think they'll try to break my balls?

Ooh, ah
Mother should I build the wall?
Mother should I run for President?
Mother should I trust the government?
Mother will they put me in the firing mine?
Ooh ah
Is it just a waste of time?

Hush now baby, baby, don't you cry
Mama's gonna make all your nightmares come true
Mama's gonna put all her fears into you
Mama's gonna keep you right here under her wing
She won't let you fly, but she might let you sing
Mama's gonna keep baby cozy and warm
Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby
Of course mama's gonna help build the wall

Mother do you think she's good enough?
For me?
Mother do you think she's dangerous
To me?
Mother will she tear your little boy apart?
Ooh ah
Mother will she break my heart?

Hush now baby, baby don't you cry
Mama's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you
Mama won't let anyone dirty get through
Mama's gonna wait up until you get in
Mama will always find out where you've been
Mama's gonna keep baby healthy and clean
Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby
You'll always be baby to me

Mother, did it need to be so high?

Does anybody here remember Vera Lynn?
Remember how she said that
We would meet again
Some sunny day?
Vera, Vera
What has become of you
Does anybody else in here
Feel the way I do?

A cloud of eiderdown
Draws around me
Softening a sound
Sleepy time, and I lie
With my love by my side
And she's breathing low

And the candle dies

When night comes down
You lock the door
The book falls to the floor

As darkness falls
The waves roll by
The seasons change
The wind is wry

Now wakes the awl
Now sleeps the swan
Behold the dream
The dream is gone

Green fields are calling
It's falling, in a golden door

And deep beneath the ground
The early morning sounds
And I go down
Sleepy time, and I lie
With my love by my side
And she's breathing low

And I rise, like a bird
In the haze, when the first rays
Touch the sky

And the night wings die

Us (us, us, us, us) and them (them, them, them, them)
And after all we're only ordinary men
Me
And you (you, you, you)
God only knows
It's not what we would choose (choose, choose) to do (to do, to do)
Forward he cried from the rear
And the front rank died
And the general sat
And the lines on the map
Moved from side to side
Black (black, black, black)
And blue (blue, blue)
And who knows which is which and who is who
Up (up, up, up, up)
And down (down, down, down, down)
And in the end it's only round 'n round (round, round, round)
Haven't you heard it's a battle of words
The poster bearer cried
"Listen son", said the man with the gun
There's room for you inside

"I mean, they're not gonna kill ya
So if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock
They won't do it again. Dig it?
I mean he get off lightly, 'cause I would've given him a thrashing
I only hit him once! It was only a difference of opinion, but really
I mean good manners don't cost nothing do they, eh?"

Down (down, down, down, down)
And out (out, out, out, out)
It can't be helped that there's a lot of it about
With (with, with, with), without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
Out of the way
It's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For the want of the price
Of tea and a slice
The old man died

Hello? Hello? Hello?

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?
Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship  smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

Okay
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb

You gotta be crazy, you gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street
You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking

And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you,
You'll get the chance to put the knife in

You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you get older
And in the end you'll pack up and fly down south
Hide your head in the sand,
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer

And when you loose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone
Dragged down by the stone (stone, stone, stone, stone, stone)

I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?

Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable and no-one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
And everything's done under the sun
And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer

Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel

Who was fitted with collar and chain
Who was given a pat on the back
Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home

Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone

A movement is accomplished in six stages
And the seventh brings return
The seven is the number of the young light
It forms when darkness is increased by one
Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset

The time is with the month of winter solstice
When the change is due to come
Thunder in the other course of heaven
Things cannot be destroyed once and for all
Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset, sunrise

I have always been here
I have always looked out from behind these eyes
It feels like more than a lifetime
Feels like more than a lifetime

Sometimes I get tired of the waiting
Sometimes I get tired of being in here
Is this the way it has always been?
Could it ever have been different?

Do you ever get tired of the waiting?
Do you ever get tired of being in there?
Don't worry, nobody lives forever,
Nobody lives forever

Into the distance a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Standing alone my senses reeled
A fatal attraction is holding me fast how
How can I escape this irresistible grasp? 

Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue tied and twisted just an earth bound misfit, I

Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladened, empty and turned to stone

A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I

Friction lock, set
Mixtures, rich
Propellers, fully forward
Flaps, set, ten degrees
Engine gauges and suction, check

Mixture set to maximum percent, recheck
Flight instruments
Altimeters, check both
(Garbled word) on
Navigation lights, on
Strobes, on
Confirm three-eight-echo ready for departure
Hello again, this is now 129.4
129.4, it's to go 
You may commence your takeoff, winds over ten knots
Three-eight-echo
Easy on the brakes, take it easy, its gonna roll this time
Just hand the power gradually, and it

Above the planet on a wing and a prayer,
My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air,
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss
Can't keep my mind from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I

The memories of a man in his old age
Are the deeds of a man in his prime.
You shuffle in gloom of the sickroom
And talk to yourself as you die.

Life is a short, warm moment
And death is a long cold rest.
You get your chance to try in the twinkling of an eye:
Eighty years, with luck, or even less.

So all aboard for the American tour,
And maybe you'll make it to the top.
And mind how you go, and I can tell you, 'cause I know
You may find it hard to get off.

You are the angel of death
And I am the dead man's son.
And he was buried like a mole in a fox hole.
And everyone is still in the run.

And who is the master of fox hounds?
And who says the hunt has begun?
And who calls the tune in the courtroom?
And who beats the funeral drum?

The memories of a man in his old age
Are the deeds of a man in his prime.
You shuffle in gloom in the sickroom
And talk to yourself till you die.

Hey Eugene
This is Henry McClean
And I've finished my beautiful flying machine
And I'm ringing to say
That I'm leaving and maybe
You'd like to fly with me
And hide with me, baby

Isn't it strange
How little we change
Isn't it sad we're insane
Playing the games that we know end in tears
The games we've been playing for thousands and thousands and thousands 

Jumps into his cosmic flyer
Pulled his plastic collar higher
Light the fuse and stand right back

He cried
This is my last goodbye

Point me at the sky and let it fly (point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly (point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly

And if you survive till two thousand and five
I hope you're exceedingly thin
For if you are stout you will have to breathe out
While the people around you breathe in (breathe in, breathe in, breathe in)

People pushing on my sides
Is something that I hate
And so is sitting down to eat
With only little capsules on my plate

Point me at the sky and let it fly (point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly (point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly

And all we've got to say to you is goodbye
It's time to go, better run and get your bags
It's goodbye
Hey Jean look at the screen and it's goodbye
Julian hey, the milky way and it's goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
I am going to say goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
Crash, goodbye

On the day the wall came down
They threw the locks onto the ground
And with glasses high we raised a cry 
For freedom had arrived

On the day the wall came down
The Ship of Fools had finally run aground
Promises lit up the night like paper doves in flight

I dreamed you had left my side
No warmth not even pride remained
And even though you needed me
It was clear that I could not do a thing for you

Now life devalues day by day
As friends and neighbours turn away
And there's a change that, even with regret
Cannot be undone

Now frontiers shift like desert sands
While nations wash their bloodied hands
Of loyalty, of history, in shades of gray

I woke to the sound of drums
The music played, the morning sun streamed in
I turned and I looked at you
And all but the bitted residue slipped away 
Slipped away

I've got a bike. You can ride it if you like
It's got a basket, a bell that rings and
Things to make it look good
I'd give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things

I've got a cloak. It's a bit of a joke
There's a tear up the front. It's red and black
I've had it for months
If you think it could look good, then I guess it should

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things

I know a mouse, and he hasn't got a house
I don't know why. I call him Gerald
He's getting rather old, but he's a good mouse

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things

I've got a clan of gingerbread men
Here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men
Take a couple if you wish. They're on the dish

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things

I know a room full of musical tunes
Some rhyme, some ching. Most of them are clockwork
Let's go into the other room and make them work

You shout in your sleep.
Perhaps the price is just too steep.
Is your conscience at rest 
If once put to the test?
You awake with a start 
To just the beating of your heart.
Just one man beneath the sky,
Just two ears, just two eyes.

You set sail across the sea 
Of long past thoughts and memories.
Childhood's end, your fantasies 
Merge with harsh realities.
And then as the sail is hoist,
You find your eyes are growing moist.
All the fears never voiced 
Say you have to make your final choice.

Who are you and who am I 
To say we know the reason why?
Some are born; some men die 
Beneath one infinite sky.
There'll be war, there'll be peace.
But everything one day will cease.
All the iron turned to rust;
All the proud men turned to dust.
And so all things, time will mend.
So this song will end.

Money, get away
Get a good job with good pay and you're okay
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four star daydream
Think I'll buy me a football team

Money, get back
I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack
Money, it's a hit
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity first class traveling set
And I think I need a Lear jet

Money, it's a crime
Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a raise it's no surprise that they're
Giving none away, away, away

I want to go home
Take off this uniform and leave the show 
And I'm waiting in this cell because I have to know 
Have I been guilty all this time?

Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave but don't leave me
Look around, choose your own ground
For long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all your touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be

Run, rabbit run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one
For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave

Bridges burning gladly 
Merging with the shadows
Flickering between the lines
Stolen moments floating softly on the air
Borne on wings of fire and climbing higher

Ancient bonds are breaking
Moving on and changing sides
Dreaming of a new day
Cast aside the other way 
Magic visions stirring
Kindled by and burning flames rise in her eye 

The doorway stands ajar
The walls that once were high 
Beyond the gilded cage
Beyond the reach of ties
The moment is at hand
She breaks the golden band

Sunlight bright upon my pillow
Lighter than an eiderdown
Will she let the weeping willow
Wind his branches round
Julia dream, dreamboat queen, queen of all my dreams
Every night I turn the light out

Waiting for the velvet bride
Will the scaly armadillo
Find me where I'm hiding
Julia dream, dreamboat queen, queen of all my dreams
Will the misty master break me
Will the key unlock my mind
Will the following footsteps catch me
Am I really dying
Julia dream, dreamboat queen, queen of all my dreams

Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
You better make your face up in
Your favorite disguise
With your button down lips and your
Roller blind eyes
With your empty smile
And your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters
When the conch shell shatters
And the hammers batter
Down your door
You'd better run

Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
You better run all day
And run all night
Keep your dirty feelings
Deep inside
And if you're taking your girlfriend
Out tonight
You'd better park the car
Well out of sight
'Cause if they catch you in the back seat
Trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to mother
In a cardboard box
You better run

"Hey, open up!"
"Hammer, hammer"

Ooh, babe
Don't leave me now

Don't say it's the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent
I need you, babe
To put through the shredder
In front of my friends

Ooh, babe
Don't leave me now

How could you go?
When you know how I need you
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night

Ooh, babe, don't leave me now

How can you treat me this way?
Running away
Ooh, babe
Why are you running away?
Ooh, babe

All is love, is all I am
A ball is all I am
I'm so new compared to you
And I am very small

Warm glow, moon bloom
Always need a little more room
Waiting here seems like years
Never seen the light of day

All around I hear strange sounds
Come gurgling in my ear
Red the light and dark the night
I feel my dawn is near

Warm glow, moon bloom
Always need a little more room
Whisper low, here I go
I will see the sunshine show

As you look around this room tonight 
Settle in your seat and dim the lights 
Do you want my blood  do you want my tears 
What do you want 
What do you want from me 
Should I sing until I can't sing any more 
Play these strings until my fingers are raw 
You're so hard to please 
What do you want from me 

Do you think I know something you don't know 
What do you want from me 
If I don't promise you the answers would you go 
What do you want from me 
Should I stand out in the rain 
Do you want me to make a daisy chain for you 
I'm not the one you need 
What do you want from me 

You can have anything you want 
You can drift, you can dream, even walk on water 
Anything you want

You can own everything you see 
Sell your soul for complete control 
Is that really what you need 

You can lose yourself this night 
See inside there is nothing to hide 
Turn and face the light 

What do you want from me

All that you touch 
All that you see 
All that you taste 
All you feel 
All that you love 
All that you hate 
All you distrust 
All you save 
All that you give 
All that you deal 
All that you buy  
Beg, borrow or steal 
All you create 
All you destroy 
All that you do 
All that you say 
All that you eat 
And everyone you meet 
All that you slight 
And everyone you fight
All that is now 
All that is gone 
All that's to come 
And everything under the sun is in tune 
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon

Ooooh, babe
Don't leave me now
Don't say it's the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent

I need you, babe
To put through the shredder
In front of my friends
Ooh babe

Don't leave me now
How could you go?
When you know how I need you
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night
Ooh babe, don't leave me now

How can you treat me this way?
Running away
Ooh babe
Why are you running away?
Ooh babe

"And I am not frightened of dying any time will do
I don't mind. Why should I be frightened of dying? 
There's no reason for it you've gotta go sometime." 
"If you can hear this whispering you are dying." 
"I never said I was frightened of dying." 

(Instrumental)

One sound, one single sound
One kiss, one single kiss
A face outside the window pane
However did it come to this?

A man who ran, a child who cried
A girl who heard, a voice that lied
The sun that burned a fiery red
The vision of an empty bed

The use of force, he was so tough
She'll soon submit, she's had enough
The march of fate, the broken will
Someone is lying very still

He has laughed and he has cried
He has fought and he has died
He's just the same as all the rest
He's not the worst, he's not the best

And still this ceaseless murmuring
The babbling that I brook
The seas of faces, eyes upraised
The empty screen, the vacant look

A man in black on a snow white horse,
A pointless life has run its course,
The red rimmed eyes, the tears still run
As he fades into the setting sun

You're going on that plane to take you where you belong.
But no, I have
You have got to listen to me. 
Do you have any idea what you have to look forward to if you stay here? 
Nine chances out of ten we both end up in a concentration camp and that
You're only saying these things to make me go.
I'm saying it 'cause it's true. Inside us, we both know we belong in different
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
But what about us?
But what about us?
But what about us?

Oh oh oh walk with me, Sydney

Walk with me, Sydney, it’s a dark night
Come on, come on, hold me tight
Well, I’d love to, love to, love to

But I got flat feet, fallen arches
Baggy knees and a broken frame
Meningitis, peritonitis
Dt's and a washed-up brain

Good morning, Worm your honor
The crown will plainly show
The prisoner who now stands before you
Was caught red-handed showing feelings
Showing feelings of an almost human nature
This will not do
Call the schoolmaster

I always said he'd come to no good
In the end your honor
If they'd let me have my way I could
Have flayed him into shape
But my hands were tied
The bleeding hearts and artists
Let him get away with murder
Let me hammer him today?

Crazy
Toys in the attic, I am crazy
Truly gone fishing
They must have taken my marbles away
Crazy, toys in the attic he is crazy

You little shit you're in it now
I hope they throw away the key
You should have talked to me more often
Than you did, but no
You had to go
Your own way, have you broken any
Homes up lately?
Just five minutes, Worm your honor
Him and me, alone

Babe
Come to mother baby, let me hold you
In my arms
M'lud I never wanted him to
Get in any trouble
Why'd he ever have to leave me?
Worm, your honor, let me take him home

Crazy,
Over the rainbow, I am crazy
Bars in the window
There must have been a door there in the wall
When I came in
Crazy, over the rainbow, he is crazy

The evidence before the court is
Incontrovertible, there's no need for
The jury to retire
In all my years of judging
I have never heard before
Of someone more deserving
Of the full penalty of law
The way you made them suffer
Your exquisite wife and mother
Fills me with the urge to defecate

Since, my friend, you have revealed your
Deepest fear
I sentence you to be exposed before
Your peers
Tear down the wall

Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave but don't leave me
Look around, choose your own ground
For long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all your touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be

Run, rabbit run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one
For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave

In a churchyard by a river 
Lazing in the haze of midday 
Laughing in the grasses and the graze
Yellow bird, you are not long
In singing and in flying on
In laughing and in leaving

Willow weeping in the water
Waving to the river daughters 
Swaying in the ripples and the reeds
On a trip to Cirrus Minor 
Saw a crater in the sun 
A thousand miles of moonlight later

I want to tell you a story
About a little man
If I can
A gnome named Grimble Crumble
And little gnomes stay in their homes
Eating, sleeping, drinking their wine

He wore a scarlet tunic
A blue green hood
It looked quite good
He had a big adventure
Amidst the grass
Fresh air at last
Wining, dining, biding his time
And then one day, hooray!
Another way for gnomes to say
Ooomray

Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn't it good?
Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn't it good?
Winding, finding places to go
And then one day, hooray!
Another way for gnomes to say
Ooomray
Ooomray

Eins, zwei, drei, alle
Ooh, you cannot reach me now
Ooh, no matter how you try
Goodbye, cruel world, it's over
Walk on by

Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come
In perfect isolation here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come

We're waiting to succeed and going to convene outside Brixton
Town Hall where we're going to be
Waiting to cut out the deadwood
Waiting to clean up the city
Waiting to follow the worms
Waiting to put on a black shirt
Waiting to weed out the weaklings
Waiting to smash in their windows
And kick in their doors
Waiting for the final solution
To strengthen the strain
Waiting to follow the worms
Waiting to turn on the showers
And fire the ovens
Waiting for the queens and the coons
And the reds and the Jews
Waiting to follow the worms

Would you like to see Britannia
Rule again, my friend?
All you have to do is follow the worms
Would you like to send our colored cousins
Home again, my friend?

All you need to do is follow the worms

The worms will convene outside Brixton Bus Station

Breathe, breathe in the air

Dig that hole, forget the sun

Her love rains down on me easy as the breeze
I listen to her breathing it sounds like the waves on the sea
I was thinking all about her, burning with rage and desire
We were spinning into darkness the earth was on fire

She could take it back, she might take it back some day

So I spy on her, I lie to her, I make promises I cannot keep
Then I hear her laughter rising, rising from the deep
And I make her prove her love for me, I take all that I can take
I push her to the limit to see if she will break

She might take it back, she could take it back some day

Now I have seen the warnings, screaming from all sides
It’s easy to ignore them, God knows I’ve tried
All of this temptation, you know it turned my faith to lies
Until I couldn’t see the danger or hear the rising tide

She can take it back, she will take it back some day
She can take it back, she will take it back some day
She will take it back, she will take it back some day

All that you touch

All that you taste

Beg, borrow or steal
All you create
All you destroy
All that you do
All that you say
All that you eat
And everyone you meet
All that you slight
And everyone you fight
All that is now
All that is gone
All that's to come
And everything under the sun is in tune
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon

Bring the boys back home
Bring the boys back home
Don't leave the children on their own, no, no
Bring the boys back home

Wrong, do it again
Time to go
Are you feeling okay?
There's a man answering, but he keeps hanging up

Is there anybody out there?

They disembarked in 45 
And no-one spoke and no-one smiled 
There were to many spaces in the line. 
Gathered at the cenotaph 
All agreed with the hand on heart 
To sheath the sacrificial Knifes. 
But now 
She stands upon Southampton dock 
With her handkerchief 
And her summer frock clings 
To her wet body in the rain. 
In quiet desperation knuckles 
White upon the slippery reins 
She bravely waves the boys Goodbye again. 

And still the dark stain spreads between 
His shoulder blades. 
A mute reminder of the poppy fields and graves. 
And when the fight was over 
We spent what they had made. 
But in the bottom of our hearts 
We felt the final cut.

I am just a new boy
Stranger in this town
Where are all the good times?
Who's gonna show this stranger around?
Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

Will some woman in this desert land
Make me feel like a real man?
Take this rock and roll refugee
Ooh, baby set me free

Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

Hello?
Yes, a collect call for Mrs. Floyd from Mister Floyd
Will you accept the charges from United States?

Oh, he hung up, that's your residence, right? I wonder why he hung up?
Is there supposed to be someone else there besides your wife there to answer?

Hello?
This is United States calling, are we reaching
See he keeps hanging up, and it's a man answering

"Well, only got an hour of daylight left. Better get started"
"Isn't it unsafe to travel at night?"
"It'll be a lot less safe to stay here, your father's gunna pick up our trail before long"
"Can Loca ride?"
"Yeah, I can ride, Margaret, time to go! Maigret, thank you for everything"
"Goodbye Chenga"
"Goodbye miss"
"I'll be back"

Is there anybody out there?

I don't need no arms around me
And I don't need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall
Don't think I'll need anything at all
No, don't think I'll need anything at all
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall
All in all you were all just bricks in the wall

Little by little the night turns around. 
Counting the leaves which tremble and turn. 
Lotus's lean on each other in union. 
Over the hills where a swallow is resting. 
Set the controls for the heart of the sun.

Over the mountain watching the watcher. 
Breaking the darkness waking the grapevine. 
Morning to birth is born into shadow 
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine. 
Set the controls for the heart of the sun. 
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun. 

Who is the man who arrives at the wall? 
Making the shape of his questions at asking. 
Thinking the sun will fall in the evening. 
Will he remember the lesson of giving? 
Set the controls for the heart of the sun. 
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun.

So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
Did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears
Wish you were here

Us (us, us, us, us) and them (them, them, them, them)
And after all we're only ordinary men
Me
And you (you, you, you)
God only knows
It's not what we would choose (choose, choose) to do (to do, to do)
Forward he cried from the rear
And the front rank died
And the general sat
And the lines on the map
Moved from side to side
Black (black, black, black)
And blue (blue, blue)
And who knows which is which and who is who
Up (up, up, up, up)
And down (down, down, down, down)
And in the end it's only round 'n round (round, round, round)
Haven't you heard it's a battle of words
The poster bearer cried
"Listen son", said the man with the gun
There's room for you inside

"I mean, they're not gonna kill ya
So if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock
They won't do it again. Dig it?
I mean he get off lightly, 'cause I would've given him a thrashing
I only hit him once! It was only a difference of opinion, but really
I mean good manners don't cost nothing do they, eh?"

Down (down, down, down, down)
And out (out, out, out, out)
It can't be helped that there's a lot of it about
With (with, with, with), without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
Out of the way
It's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For the want of the price
Of tea and a slice
The old man died

I was standing by the Nile 
When I saw the lady smile 
I would take her out for a while 
For a while

Oh, my tears wept like a child 
How her golden hair was blowing wild
Then she spread her wings to fly
For to fly

Soaring high above the breezes
Going always where she pleases 
She will make it to the islands in the sun

I will follow in her shadow 
As I watch her from my window
One day I will catch her eye

She is calling from the deep
Summoning my soul to endless sleep 
She is bound to drag me down
Drag me down
