Following the path as it leads toward
The darkness in the north
Weary stranger's faces show their sympathy
They've seen that hope before

And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
For you the night is beckoning
And now you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
And you must you realize be on your way

Mystery swelling, creatures crawling
Hear the roar Jer louder in your ears
You know the folly was your own
But the force behind can't conquer all you fears

And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
For you the night is beckoning and you know
And now you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
And you must you realize be on your way

Throw your thoughts back many years
To the time when love was life with every morning
Perhaps a day will come when the match 
For me the curlers past warning

And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
For you the night is beckoning
And now you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
And you must you realize be on your way

Bring the boys back home
Bring the boys back home
Don't leave the children on their own, no, no
Bring the boys back home

Wrong, do it again
Time to go
Are you feeling okay?
There's a man answering, but he keeps hanging up

Is there anybody out there?

F*ck all that we've got to get on with these 
Gotta compete with the wily Japanese
There's too many home fires burning 
And not enough trees
So f*ck all that 
We've go to get on with these

Can't stop!
Lose job! 
Mind gone!
Silicon! 
What bomb?
Get away! 
Pay day!
Make hay! 
Break down! 
Need fix. 
Big six. 
Clickity click. 
Hold on! 
Oh no, 
Bring bingo! 

Make 'em laugh 
Make 'em cry 
Make 'em dance in the aisles 
Make 'em pay 
Make 'em stay 
Make 'em feel okay

We've got to get on with the film show
Hollywood waits at the end of the rainbow
Who cares what it's about 
As long as the kids go? 
Not now John we've
Got to get on with the show

Hang on John I've got to get on with this
I don't know what it is 
But it fits on here like
Come at the end of the shift
We'll go and get pissed
Not now John 
I've got to get on with this 

Hold on John 
I think there's something good on 
I used to read books but
It could be the news 
Or some other amusement
It could be reusable shows 

F*ck all that we've got to get on with these 
Got to compete with the wily Japanese
No need to worry about the Vietnamese
Got to bring the Russian Bear to his knees 
Well, maybe not the Russian Bear 
Maybe the Swedes
We showed Argentina 
Now let's go and show these
Make us feel tough 
And wouldn't Maggie be pleased? 
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah!

Oh! Rule Britannia! Britannia rules the day
