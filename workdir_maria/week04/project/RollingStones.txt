I met a gin-soaked, bar-room queen in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride
She had to heave me right across shoulder
'Cause I just can't seem to drink you off my mind

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

I laid a divorc√©e in New York City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
The lady then she covered me with roses
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues
It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

Smell of you baby, my senses, my senses be praised
Smell of you baby, my senses, my senses be praised

Kissing and running, kissing and running away
Kissing and running, kissing and running away
Senses be praised
Senses be praised

Your my saving grace, saving grace
Nothing will harm you
Nothing will stand in your way
Nothing, nothing
Nothing will stop you
And nothing will stand in your way
No one will harm you
No one will stand in your way
No one will bar you
Nothing will stand in your way
Nothing
There's nothing

I can't feel 
Feel a thing 
I can't shout 
I can't scream 
Breathe it out 
Breathe it in 
All this love 
From within 

I won't cry when you say goodbye 
I'm out of tears 
And I won't die when you wave goodbye 
I'm out of tears 
Out of tears 

I won't drink 
I won't eat 
I can't hear 
I won't speak 
Let it out 
Let it in 
All this pain 
From within 
And I just can't pour my heart out 
To another living thing 
I'm a whisper 
I'm a shadow 
But I'm standing up to sing 

I won't cry when you say goodbye 
I'm out of tears (out of tears)
I won't die when you wave goodbye 
I'm out of tears, yes I am 
I won't cry, I swear my eyes are dry 
I'm out of tears, yeah (out of tears)
I won't cry, I'm going to tell you why 
I'm out of tears 
Out of tears 
Out of tears 

Let it out 
From within 
Some you lose 
Some you win 
I can drift 
I can dream 
'Til I float 
Off your screen 
And I just can't pour my heart out 
To another living thing 
I'm a whisper 
I'm a shadow 
But I'm standing up to sing 

And I won't cry when you say goodbye 
I'm out of tears (out of tears) 
I won't die when you wave goodbye 
I'm out of tears, out of tears
I won't cry, I swear my eyes are dry 
I'm out of tears, out of tears 
I won't cry, I'm going to tell you why 
I'm out of tears 
Out of tears 
Out of tears
